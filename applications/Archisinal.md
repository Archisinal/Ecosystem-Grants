## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

- Archisinal wants to become the Opensea for professionals in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC).
- Through on-chain tokenization of designs, professionals in the AEC industry can reduce the quantity and length of arbitration disputes and gain exposure to the creator economy through royalties from secondary sales.
- The purpose of this document is to provide an executive summary for a template aimed at building an innovative NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace for architects and engineers. This platform will revolutionize the way professionals in the architectural and engineering sectors trade, showcase, and monetize their digital assets, whilst enabling a global audience to access and acquire unique pieces of digital art and design.
- Whilst both Ink! and Solidity are popular programming languages for building smart contracts and decentralized applications, there are some key reasons why Ink! may be better suited for building the Archisinal NFT marketplace:

**Runtime efficiency:** Ink! is built on the Substrate framework and optimized for the Polkadot ecosystem. Substrate uses the WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime, which offers better performance and is more resource-efficient than the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used by Solidity. This can lead to faster transaction processing and lower fees for users on an NFT marketplace.

**Interoperability:** Polkadot, the ecosystem where Ink! is primarily used, is designed for cross-chain communication and interoperability. This means that an NFT marketplace built using Ink! can more easily interact with other blockchains and their assets. This can be a significant advantage for users looking to trade NFTs across different platforms.

**Scalability:** The Polkadot ecosystem has a more scalable architecture compared to Ethereum, which is a key concern for NFT marketplaces that may experience high volumes of transactions. Polkadot uses parachains and a relay chain to process transactions in parallel, while Ethereum currently relies on a single chain that can become congested during peak periods.

**Upgradability:** Ink! contracts can be easily upgraded, allowing developers to implement new features and improvements without disrupting the user experience. This is particularly important for an NFT marketplace, as new features and standards may emerge over time. In contrast, upgrading Solidity contracts can be more complex and sometimes require creating entirely new contracts.

**Lower fees:** As Polkadot has a more efficient consensus mechanism and resource usage, transaction fees are generally lower compared to Ethereum. Lower fees can attract more users to an NFT marketplace and facilitate more transactions, making the platform more accessible and user-friendly.

- The objective of the Archisinal project is to build a NFT marketplace that is similar to Opensea, but tailored to the specific needs of architects, and engineers by providing them a wider audience to connect with for on- and off-chain work engagements. Archisinal wants to become the ‘go-to platform’ for architects and designers to generate more revenue by easily creating and selling unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets as NFTs on the Astar blockchain. By leveraging smart contract functionality, architects will be provided with a platform for architects to showcase and sell their designs as unique digital assets, and earn royalties from secondary sales. With its search functionality and easy buying and selling capabilities, it will also make it easy for architecture enthusiasts to discover and purchase designs that interest them.

Holding the digital asset provides value in two main funnels:

1) To buy, hold and sell like typical NFT art 

2) Utility token - holding the token for a particular designer gives the holder token-gated access to the original creator to develop the design into a physical product

**Philosophical Questioning:** 
*'’In it’s simplest terms, let’s take the scenario of the architect responsible for delivering the design of the house that Michael Jackson lived in during his childhood. The fee for such work would have been in-line with that of a mid-60’s, Indiana based architect. If this design work was available as an immutable token of authenticity today, it would have experienced an increase in value proportional to that of the singer’s profile.'’*

## The Case For Architects

It is difficult to provide exact figures* for how much famous architects were paid for designing famous structures, as the fees can vary widely depending on the scale and complexity of the project, the reputation of the architect, and the time period in which they were working. Additionally, many architects are paid a percentage of the total construction cost, which can be influenced by factors such as materials, labor, and economic conditions.

Here are a few examples of well-known architects and their famous structures, but keep in mind that these are approximate figures and may not account for inflation or other factors:

**Frank Lloyd Wright:** Wright designed many iconic buildings during his career, such as Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum. It is estimated that he may have earned between 5-15% of the construction cost for his projects, but exact amounts are not publicly available.

**Le Corbusier:** Known for designing Villa Savoye and the Unite d'Habitation, Le Corbusier's fees would have varied based on the project. Again, exact amounts are not available, but he may have earned a similar percentage to other architects of his time.

**Zaha Hadid:** As a contemporary architect, Zaha Hadid's fees were likely more transparent. Her firm designed the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympics, which cost around £269 million. If her firm received a standard fee of around 5-15% of the construction cost, they could have earned £13.5-£40 million for the project.

**Norman Foster:** Foster's firm designed the iconic Gherkin building in London, which cost an estimated £138 million to construct. If his firm received a standard fee of around 5-15% of the construction cost, they could have earned £7-£20.7 million for the project.

With the advent of new technologies, particularly blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the landscape of the art and design world is undergoing significant changes. By minting their designs as NFTs, architects can take advantage of these changes to create new revenue streams, protect their intellectual property, and increase the value of their work.

### Why architects should consider minting their designs as NFTs:

**Ownership and provenance:** NFTs use blockchain technology to create a decentralized digital ledger that securely records the ownership and provenance of digital assets. By minting their designs as NFTs, architects can establish a clear and indisputable record of their authorship, ensuring that their work is correctly attributed and valued.

**Scarcity and uniqueness:** NFTs are unique digital tokens that cannot be replicated or replaced, which gives them inherent value due to their scarcity. By minting a limited number of NFTs for each design, architects can create a sense of exclusivity and increase the value of their work, just as limited edition prints or numbered artworks do in traditional art markets.

**Intellectual property protection:** NFTs can help architects protect their intellectual property by ensuring that any digital reproductions of their designs are traced back to the original creator. With the rise of digital design tools and online platforms, it has become increasingly easy for designs to be copied or plagiarized. NFTs can serve as a deterrent to unauthorized use and provide a clear legal framework for the enforcement of copyright claims.

**Royalties and secondary market sales:** One of the most significant benefits of NFTs for architects is the ability to earn royalties from secondary market sales. When an NFT changes hands, a smart contract can be programmed to automatically pay a percentage of the sale price back to the original creator. This provides architects with a passive income stream and ensures they continue to benefit from the success of their work.

**Cross-disciplinary collaboration and innovation:** The NFT space is characterized by a vibrant and experimental community of creators working across various disciplines, including art, music, and design. By minting their designs as NFTs, architects can collaborate with other artists and explore new forms of expression and creativity, pushing the boundaries of their practice.

## Product Vision

This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

1. *User Experience:* The user experience should be simple and intuitive, with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for architects to mint, buy, sell, and manage their NFTs.
2. *Smart Contracts:* The marketplace should be built on blockchain technology, with smart contracts that handle the minting, buying, selling, and royalty distribution of NFTs.
3. *Royalty Distribution:* The marketplace should have a built-in mechanism for distributing royalties to architects for secondary sales of their NFTs. This will help to incentivize architects to create and sell their designs on the marketplace.
4. *Search and Discovery:* The marketplace should have a robust search and discovery feature, allowing users to easily find the designs they are looking for.
5. *3D integration:* The marketplace should have the ability to integrate with 3D modeling software and easily import designs. (Post-MVP)
6. *Security:* The marketplace should have robust security measures in place to protect against fraud and hacking, including two-factor authentication and encryption of user data.
7. *Community:* The marketplace should have a built-in community feature, where architects can connect and collaborate with other architects, share their designs, and get feedback.
8. *Scalability*: The marketplace should be designed to handle a high volume of transactions and users, with the ability to scale up as needed.
9. *Revenue Streams*: The marketplace should have multiple revenue streams, such as transaction fees, advertising, and other services, to ensure long-term sustainability.
10. *Legal Compliance:* The marketplace should be compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to NFTs and blockchain technology. (not included in MVP)

### Project Details
